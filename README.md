# ImageConvOp
Use of Pillow to make changes to a bunch of images

This mini-project demonstrates the process of automating a certain amount of changes that were needed to be made to a bunch of images.

The images were originally designed by a graphics designer.
They have been designed in TIFF format, have size 192 x 192 and 90 degrees anticlockwise off position.

The python scripts iterates over the files in the **images.zip** file, which must be present in the same directory as the python script.
The images are corrected and converted to JPEG format and stored in **opt/icons** directory **opt** is at the same level, as the py script.

To run the program, download the bash script, python script and the images zip file into one directory. 
Then run the following code:

`sudo chmod +x executeImageOperation.sh`

Enter your password and the images should be extracted and processed within no time!
